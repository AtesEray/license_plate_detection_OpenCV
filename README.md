# license_plate_detection_OpenCV
license plate detection 

# Version 1

Currently, the project is in its initial version. However, the license plate detection feature is not yet fully functional. In upcoming versions, I am actively working on improving the license plate detection algorithm to adapt to various scenarios, thereby increasing the success rate

#What can you do with version 1 ?

*You can easily identify the license plates of vehicles taken from a proper and close angle.
*It currently does not work effectively for photos taken from a distance and at wrong angles.
